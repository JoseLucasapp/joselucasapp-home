It features a fully custom lexer, parser, compiler, and virtual machine, providing an educational yet powerful platform to explore language design concepts. Zumbra supports basic types like integers, floats, booleans, and strings, control flow structures like if and for, and logical operators with proper short-circuit evaluation. Designed for clarity, simplicity, and extensibility, Zumbra is the perfect playground for learning how modern programming languages work internally."
